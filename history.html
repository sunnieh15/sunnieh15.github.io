  <h1>Our History</h1>

  <div class="container2">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column-full">
        <p>The Antioch Baptist Church was born on September 25, 1924, during a time period in America known as the "Roaring Twenties." The lifestyle in the Deanwood community at that time was rural. Where many of the present day houses, apartments and schools now stand, there were trees and large gardens where fruits, vegetables, chickens and hogs were raised just 91 years ago. Some of the residents built their homes with their own hands. The streets weren&rsquo;t paved as we know them today, but were dirt roads covered with cinders and rocks. And there never was a parking problem, because very few people owned cars.</p>
        <p>It was into this community of hard working people and their families that our founder, Rev. Junius A. Wheeler, walked. He came with a vision of what the Lord could do in the lives of everyone who lived there, and he lived to see much of that vision fulfilled. In 1923, Rev. Wheeler was 42 years old and the assistant pastor at New Bethel Baptist Church. He stepped out on faith, following definite directions from the Lord, to start a new church, with the goal of reaching his community with the Good News of Jesus Christ! The first official service of this brand new church was held on Sunday, September 28, 1924.</p>
        <p>After the pastor&rsquo;s death in August of 1962, Rev. James A. Davis served the Lord faithfully for nearly 2 years. The church called Rev. B.M. Fauntroy on May 7, 1964 and he served as pastor until 1969. Rev. James A. Davis once again became interim pastor. Rev. Fred X. Porter was called as pastor in November 1971. Rev. James Davis became the only minister to serve as assistant to all 3 of Antioch&rsquo;s pastors. Rev. Porter served for 11 years until his resignation in 1983. Rev. Arnor S. Davis became interim pastor in 1983. On Friday, July 20, 1984, Rev. David K. North was called to the pastorate of the Antioch Baptist Church. He resigned in 1991. Rev. William H. Gibbs was called to be pastor of the church February 20, 1993. Rev. Gibbs served faithfully as the Shepard of this branch of Zion for 22 years, retiring in January 2015.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2014, the Pastoral Search Committee led by the Holy Spirit, selected Rev. Dr. Eric E. Baldwin as the most qualified for the pastoral position and in December 2014 the members unanimously voted to offer Dr. Baldwin the position of Pastor. Dr. Baldwin accepted and preached his first sermon as Pastor on Sunday, February 1, 2015. We pray that his years here will be fruitful and a blessing not only to Antioch but to the Deanwood Community.</p>
        <p>Our congregation is a friendly group of people who enjoy coming together to praise our Lord. We would be happy to have you join us and to get to know you better. We know you will find our church family to be one that enthusiastically embraces newcomers and warmly welcomes them into our fellowship. We are a Bible believing and teaching church, filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
